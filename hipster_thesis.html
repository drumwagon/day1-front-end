        	<h1>Hipsters</h1>

        	<h2>Overview</h2>
        	<p>Hipster refers to a postmodern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture%E2%80%9D" class="subC">subculture</a> of young, urban middle-class adults and older teenagers that first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2010s,[1] being derived from earlier movements in the 1940s. The subculture is associated with indie music and alternative music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility (including vintage and thrift store clothes), progressive or independent political views,[2][3] and alternative lifestyles.</p>
        	<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
        	<p>Hipster culture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]".[4] Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York argues that "hipsterism fetishizes the authentic" elements of all of the "fringe movements of the postwar eraâ€”beat, hippie, punk, even grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity", reinventing it "with a winking inauthenticity."[5] Lorentzen says that hipsters are mostly white 18- to 34-year old people.</p>
